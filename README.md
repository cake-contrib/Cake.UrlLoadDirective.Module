# Cake.UrlLoadDirective.Module
A Cake module for loading cake files from arbitrary URL's via the `#load` directive

By default, the `#load` preprocessor directive only supports local file system paths.

This module will allow cake script files from any url to be loaded, for example:

```
#load url:https://someurl.com/somefile.cake
```

Notice the `url:` in front of the actual url.  This is required to indicate to the preprocessor directive that you want to load a url.

# Installation

Installing a Cake Module is pretty simple.  Just add a file like this:
`./tools/Modules/packages.config`

With the content:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<packages>
	<package id="Cake.UrlLoadDirective.Module" version="1.0.2" />
</packages>
```

You should now be all set and able to use it in your scripts!
